This project is a Flask-based Python script designed to retrieve problem statements and code details from Codeforces, a popular competitive programming platform. The application integrates with React frontend for user interaction and utilizes Selenium for web scraping functionalities.

Features:
 . Dynamic Problem Statement Retrieval: Users can input a Codeforces URL via the React frontend, and the Flask backend fetches the problem statement and code details from the specified URL.
 . Seamless Integration: The combination of Flask and React allows for a smooth user experience, enabling easy input of URLs and displaying fetched information seamlessly on the webpage.
 . Web Scraping with Selenium: The application employs Selenium, a powerful web scraping tool, to extract problem statements and code details from Codeforces dynamically. This ensures accurate and up-to-date information retrieval.
Dependencies:

 . Flask: A micro web framework for Python used for building the backend server.
 . React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, utilized for the frontend development.
 . Selenium: A web scraping tool used for automating web browser interaction, employed to extract information from Codeforces dynamically.
